			<p>
				Blues is a music genre and musical form which was originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1860s by African-Americans from roots in African-American work songs, and spirituals.<br><br> Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. <br><br>The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. <br><br>Blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

				The term Blues may have come from "blue devils", meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is in George Colman's one-act farce Blue Devils (1798). <br><br>The phrase blue devils may also have been derived from Britain in the 1600s, when the term referred to the "intense visual hallucinations that can accompany severe alcohol withdrawal". <br><br>As time went on, the phrase lost the reference to devils, and it came to mean a state of agitation or depression. <br><br>By the 1800s in the United States, the term blues was associated with drinking alcohol, a meaning which survives in the phrase blue law, which prohibits the sale of alcohol on Sunday. <br><br>Though the use of the phrase in African-American music may be older, it has been attested to in print since 1912, when Hart Wand's "Dallas Blues" became the first copyrighted blues composition.<br><br>In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood.

			<p>
				After World War II, new styles of electric blues became popular in cities such as Chicago, Memphis, Detroit and St. Louis. Electric blues used electric guitars, double bass (gradually replaced by bass guitar), drums, and harmonica (or "blues harp") played through a microphone and a PA system or an overdriven guitar amplifier.<br><br> Chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by Delta blues, because many performers had migrated from the Mississippi region.<br>

 						Popular musicians like Bo Diddley and <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9F%A5%E5%85%8B%C2%B7%E8%B4%9D%E9%87%8C?fromtitle=Chuck+Berry&fromid=8422329" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>Chuck Berry</strong></a>, both recording for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Records"title='Click To Learn More' target='_blank'><strong>Chess Records</strong></a>, being influenced by the Chicago blues, their enthusiastic playing styles departed from the melancholy aspects of blues.<br><br>

				<u>IN THE 1960s AND 1970s…</u>
			</h1>
			<p>
				The blues wave that brought artists such as Muddy Waters to the foreground had stopped in the early 1960s.However, blues performers such as <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/john%20lee%20hooker" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>John Lee Hooker</strong></a> and Muddy Waters continued to perform to enthusiastic audiences, inspiring new artists steeped in traditional blues, such as New York–born Taj Mahal.<br><br><a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/B.B.King" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>B. B. King's</strong></a> singing and virtuoso guitar technique earned him the eponymous title "king of the blues".<br><br>Tennessee-born Bobby "Blue" Bland, like B. B. King, also straddled the blues and R&B genres. During this period, Freddie King and <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%89%BE%E5%B0%94%E4%BC%AF%E7%89%B9%C2%B7%E9%87%91/15912924?fromtitle=Albert%20King&fromid=4052229" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>Albert King</strong></a> often played with rock and soul musicians (<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%9F%83%E9%87%8C%E5%85%8B%C2%B7%E5%B8%95%E7%89%B9%E9%87%8C%E5%85%8B%C2%B7%E5%85%8B%E8%8E%B1%E6%99%AE%E9%A1%BF?fromtitle=Eric+Clapton&fromid=1971705" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>Eric Clapton</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._%26_the_M.G.%27s" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>Booker T & the MGs</strong></a>) and had a major influence on those styles of music.<br><br>In the early 1970s, the <i><strong>Texas rock-blues</strong></i> style emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles. In contrast with the West Side blues, the Texas style is strongly influenced by the British rock-blues movement. <br><br>Major artists of the Texas style are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Winter" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>Johnny Winter</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>Stevie Ray Vaughan</strong></a><i><strong>(SRV)</strong></i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabulous_Thunderbirds" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>the Fabulous Thunderbirds</strong></a><i><strong>(led by harmonica player and singer-songwriter Kim Wilson)</strong></i>, and <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/ZZ%20Top" target='_blank' title='Click To Learn More'><strong>ZZ Top</strong></a>.

				<u>1980s TO THE PRESENT…</u>
			</h1>
			<p>
				Since the 1980s there has been a resurgence of interest in blues and a continuation in both traditional and new forms.<br>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>In 1986 the album Strong Persuader announced Robert Cray as a major blues artist.<br><br></strong></li>
					<li><strong>The Texas-based guitarist exploded onto the international stage with SRV's recording <i>Texas Flood</i>.<br><br></strong></li>
					<li><strong> Eric Clapton made a comeback in the 1990s with his album <i>Unplugged</i>, in which he played some standard blues numbers on acoustic guitar.<br><br></strong></li>
					<li><strong>In the 1980s and 1990s, blues publications such as Living Blues and Blues Revue were launched, major cities began forming blues societies, outdoor blues festivals became more common, and more nightclubs and venues for blues emerged.<br><br></strong></li>
					<li><strong>Digital multitrack recording and other technological advances and new marketing strategies including video clip production increased costs, challenging the <strong>spontaneity</strong> and <strong>improvisation</strong> that are an important component of blues music.<br><br></strong></li>
					<li><strong>Today, although the blues isn't enjoying as much recognition and reputation as it was back in the 20th century, many new bloods still seem to take to the genre early in life. For some, acclaim comes easily, others spend a lifetime making music before, suddenly, coming into the spotlight. Great modern blues artists are still paying homage to the tradition of the blues, keeping it alive and sound.</strong></li>
